Abstract:

In this project, we utilized computational modeling techniques to investigate the dynamics of advection and diffusion in Uromieh Lake, a significant saltwater lake in Iran. Advection and diffusion are fundamental processes governing the transport of substances within aquatic systems, and understanding their dynamics is crucial for effective environmental management.

We implemented a numerical model using Fortran programming language to simulate the advection and diffusion processes within the lake. The model considered various parameters such as velocity fields, concentration gradients, and diffusion coefficients to accurately represent the transport of substances, such as pollutants or nutrients, within the lake.

Two scenarios were developed to explore different source-sink dynamics within Uromieh Lake. In the first scenario, we investigated a situation where the source of a substance exceeded the sink, leading to potential accumulation and concentration within certain regions of the lake. Conversely, in the second scenario, we examined a scenario where the sink of a substance outweighed the source, resulting in depletion or dilution of the substance within the lake.

Our findings provide valuable insights into the transport dynamics of substances within Uromieh Lake under varying environmental conditions. By elucidating the interplay between advection, diffusion, and source-sink dynamics, our study contributes to the understanding of pollutant dispersion, nutrient cycling, and overall ecosystem health within the lake.

This project serves as a demonstration of the application of computational modeling techniques for studying complex environmental systems and highlights the importance of considering source-sink dynamics in environmental management strategies. The developed model and scenarios can serve as valuable tools for further research and decision-making processes aimed at preserving and managing the ecological integrity of Uromieh Lake and similar aquatic ecosystems.
